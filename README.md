# Paradox

See [the official page](http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/cache/www.cs.chalmers.se/~koen/paradox/)
for a description, papers, real authors.

This repository is a copy of the last distribution I could find (from 2010â€¦)
with some changes to make it compile on GHC 7.10.3 and C++11. I also expect to
clean up the code a bit.
